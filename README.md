Experimenting with creating a custom text input like a one-time-password input 

You can start up the app in a dev environment just like any react app with: `npm run start`

The app is also dockerised in a production-like environment, to run this:

Build the image: `docker build -t <image-name> .`

Run the image: `docker run -p 80:80 <image-name>`
